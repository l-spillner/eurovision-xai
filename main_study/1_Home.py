This is a research study on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) performs in a domain where human judgement is often very subjective: *music* ðŸŽµ

The **Eurovision Song Contest** will take place between May 9th and May 13th 2023. In preparation, we have trained an AI model to predict whether or not a song will perform well at the contest. 
Your first task will be to have a look at ten randomly selected songs, and decide for each song: is it more likely to win the contest, or be placed last?
Afterwards, you can review your selection with our AI tool, before submitting your final choices. Finally, we will ask you to answer a few questions about how useful the AI tool was in making your decisions.""")

##### About this study:

The entire study should take up to 15-20 minutes. All your answers will be collected anonymously. We do not collect personal information, like your name or IP address. If you want, you can add your score to the leaderboards on the last page, which will not be used in our research. You are free to quit the study at any time.

The data that we collect is stored on a server of the University of Bremen, in Germany. After the study finishes, the data from all participants will be analysed together and the results might be published in future research papers. We will not publish the answers or performance of any individual participant. Please note that since your data is not linked to any personal identifying information, we will not be able to delete your data later. 

If you have any questions about this study, please contact:

Laura Spillner (laura.spillner@uni-bremen.de) or Rachel Ringe (rringe@uni-bremen.de)

If you want to proceed with the study, please click "Start"!
